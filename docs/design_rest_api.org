* REST Endpoints

The Pushy REST API allows you to create jobs and retrieve status.

** /organizations/ORGNAME/pushy/jobs

*** POST

Starts a new job.

POST body:

#+begin_example
{

  "run_timeout": 300,
  "nodes": ["NODE1", "NODE2", "NODE3", "NODE4", "NODE5", "NODE6"]
}
#+end_example

401 - Unknown or inauthentic user
403 - User not authorized to create jobs
404 - Organization does not exist

*** GET

Gets a list of all jobs ever run in the system.  TODO perhaps this is not such a
good idea, eh.  This needs more design, both input and output.

#+begin_example
[
  "aaaaaaaaaaaa25fd67fa8715fd547d3d",
  "aaaaaaaaaaaa6af7b14dd8a025777cf0"

** /organizations/ORGNAME/pushy/jobs/<id>

*** GET

Gets the status of an individual job.  TODO restrict command.

Response:

The response includes the current status of the job, as well as every node in
the job, organized by its status.

#+begin_example
{
  "id": "aaaaaaaaaaaa25fd67fa8715fd547d3d",
  "command": "chef-client",
  "run_timeout": 300,
  "status": "running",
  "created_at": "Tue, 04 Sep 2012 23:01:02 GMT",
  "updated_at": "Tue, 04 Sep 2012 23:17:56 GMT",
  "nodes": {
    "running": ["NODE1", "NODE5"],
    "complete": ["NODE2", "NODE3", "NODE4"],
    "crashed": ["NODE6"]
  }
}
#+end_example

"updated_at":

updated_at represents when the job entered its present state (voting, running,
complete, etc.).  updated_at is *not* updated when node statuses update.

Job Statuses ("status"):

The job status represents the progress of the overall job.  complete,
quorum_failed, timed_out and aborted are terminal states: job and node states
will not change after that.

voting        - Waiting for nodes to commit or refuse to run the command.
running       - Running the command on the nodes.
complete      - Ran the command.  Check individual node statuses to see if they
                completed or had issues.
quorum_failed - Did not run the command on any nodes.
timed_out     - Timed out while running the job.
aborted       - Job aborted by user.

Node Statuses ("nodes"):

These statuses represent the progress of a node running a job.  All states
except new, ready and running are *terminal states*--the node's state will not
change after that.

new         - Node has neither committed nor refused to run the command.
ready       - Node has committed to run the command but has not yet run it.
running     - Node is presently running the command.
complete    - Node ran the command to completion.
aborted     - Node ran the command but stopped before completion.
crashed     - Node went down after it started running
nacked      - Node was busy when asked to be part of the job.
unavailable - Node went down before it started running

Error Codes:

200 - OK
400 - Bad signature headers
401 - Unknown or inauthentic user
403 - User not authorized to read jobs
404 - Organization or job does not exist

** /organizations/ORGNAME/pushy/node_states

*** GET

Gets a list of all nodes and their up/down status.  TODO make this compacter?
Add job node is committed to?  If we add that, we need to ensure that updated_at
reflects it, or make it clear in the docs that updated_at only reflects status.

#+begin_example
