* Client
** consume the configuration endpoint
** Discard unsent messages after disconnect

* Server
** write node status to the DB (currently just kept in gen_fsm process)
** expose a configuration endpoint for clients
** query DB for client public key (currently client/server keypairs in keys/ dir are used)
** pushy_node_status_tracker:send_heartbeat/3 call to pushy_node_state_sup:new could start an endless loop of death.
